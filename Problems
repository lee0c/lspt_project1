Coding Standard:
	pep8
Test plan:
	Black box
	White box - if needed
		Will decide in the future depending on corner cases
Metrics:
	Search engine quality:
		1. Test case pass rate
			Test metadata output
		2. Ease of use

	Software development process:
		1. Test coverage:
			Maintain high branch coverage
			Can add white box tests to achieve this
		2. Code Reviews	

		*3: Schedule
	
	Code base:
		1. Readbility
			Comments
			Coding standard
		2. Organization
			Split into proper number of files
			Good class structure
			Functions placed near other related functions
