Notes with other Text Transformation team:
  - indexing should handle n-grams
  - store all output in JSON
    - metadata
    - word list
  - either:
*   - be called from crawler with specific filename (one instance handles file)
    - watch a directory for new files
  - IF indexing is pulling from a directory:
    - write to file
    - close file
    - move file to indexing's directory so there is no permissions issue
