Large Scale Programming &amp; Testing Project 1 (Search Engine Architecture)

Team "Z"

# Design preferences:
1. Indexing: Map out where in each document any given word can be found. Notate extant fields like title and author.

2. Ranking: Use inlink analysis and index date (with bi/tri-gram analysis) to generate a ranked list of documents for a search query

3. Text transformation: Strip out html tags and clean text to prepare it for indexing. Potentially find and order metadata like title, author, date, tags, etc.
