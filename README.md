# lspt_project1: Z
Large Scale Programming &amp; Testing Project 1 (Search Engine Architecture)

Members:

# Design preferences:
1. Indexing: Map out where in each document any given word can be found. Notate extant fields like title and author.
2. Ranking: Use inlink analysis and index date (with bi/tri-gram analysis) to generate a ranked list of documents for a search query
3. Text transformation: Strip out html tags and clean text to prepare it for indexing. Potentially find and order metadata like title, author, date, tags, etc.

# Progress
* Initial presentation on design, components, test plan, and quality standards
* Initial design document details language, input & output, program flow & components, test plans, quality metrics, and coding standard
