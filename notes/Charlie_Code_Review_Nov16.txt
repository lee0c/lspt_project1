plaintext_parser.py:
  Refer to other code review notes
  Turn into class
  include metadata function stub
  rename into PlaintextParser.py -> make a class

md_parser.py:
  Turn into class
  include metadata function stub
  rename into MarkdownParser.py -> make a class

Bs4Wrapper.py:
  typo in class definition: simply interface -> simple interface
  not python3 compliant, i.e. print statements need to be using print()

  !!! We are now changing the design of our component: metadata is no longer its own
  component, instead it will be included in each parser; each type of file has different
  ways of extracting metadata
